# Hook_project

Press "E" to start the hooking, during the hooking, the player can change the application direction with motion control. 

The cod in Source\CMC_project CMC_projectCharacter.h and CustomMovementComponent.h And BP_ThirdPersonCharacter

I am using the radial force component to simulate the hook psychic, and custom my own Custom movement component psychic to make the hooking psychic can by custom.
